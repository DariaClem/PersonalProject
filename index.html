                            <p>For my C++ project, I incorporated object-oriented programming concepts such as
                                upcasting, downcasting, virtual functions, and operator overloading to develop a story
                                about the French Resistance during World War II. By utilizing these techniques, I was
                                able to create a well-structured project that accurately conveyed the spirit of the
                                historical event. The use of object-oriented programming allowed for greater flexibility
                                and organization in my code, making it easier to maintain and modify as needed.</p>

                    <h2>Art projects</h2>
                    <p>Drawing has been a significant passion of mine since I was young. It started with simple doodles
                        and progressed into more complex works of art that capture my emotions and mood. I have always
                        found joy in expressing myself through art, and it has become an essential part of my life.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        During my formative years, I was fortunate enough to participate in a painting workshop in my
                        hometown. This experience helped me hone my skills and learn what it's like to work in a
                        professional studio. I was able to work with other artists and share techniques and
                        ideas.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        While I did not choose to pursue a career in art, painting remains an important hobby of mine.
                        During my time in high school, I volunteered for the school magazine and created personalized
                        drawings for various themes. Working with a team of people who held different roles and
                        responsibilities was an enlightening experience. The hard work we put into the magazine paid off
                        when we discovered that it was a national contest winner, which was a significant achievement
                        for all of us.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In summary, drawing and painting have been a constant source of joy and inspiration in my life.
                        Although I did not choose to pursue a career in art, I will always have a deep appreciation for
                        the creativity and passion that it requires.</p>

                    <h2>Blender projects</h2>
                    <p>During high school, I stumbled upon 3D design by accident. I was completely fascinated when I
                        discovered the Blender application and realized how many things you can create with it. I
                        started with the tutorial, namely "Donut" made by Blender Guru. This represents the cornerstone
                        for any 3D designer in Blender.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I quickly became consumed by the frenzy of creation and completed various projects that I
                        reproduced with the help of tutorials. Later, I tried to create my own works. Although I have a
                        long way to go, I can say that I am very excited about what the future holds for me and I can't
                        wait to create new works.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In a few words, I can say that 3D design combines two of my passions: computer science and
                        drawing, passions that I have described earlier.</p>
